A CMS on the basis of WordPress, because I need to learn node.js properly

## Disclaimer

This is very much a work in progress, do not expect this to work anytime soon

## Install

Clone it, type `npm install`, configure it (I don't know how yet) to work on your machine, and hit `node app`

## TODO

* Get configuration under my belt (probably a config.json or something similar, much like wp-config.php)
* Get minimum viable admin area working
* Get authentication and cookie management working
* Get database schema under control
* Figure out what to do after these
